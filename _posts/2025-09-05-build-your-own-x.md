怎么证明会什么技能/技术/编程语言？

或者有时候不知道学习的程度到什么样了？

不知道方向了，就去看看市场缺什么实际的人才？

面试能过，能让别人知道你能胜任这个岗位，这很不错。一个证明。

为了面试能过，你想要真正学懂，去问自己是不是真的懂了，怎么证明自己懂？

去研究，面试会问什么？这就是方向。

### common technology is no sense to me 

Other people or company achieved it, but it's no sense for you.

you didnt achieved it right?

we should to help others to achieve, instead of push out boring service.

or it should be two way, a service to let common people just immidiately use it. anouther one to make other people to achieve it. can i make earning?
