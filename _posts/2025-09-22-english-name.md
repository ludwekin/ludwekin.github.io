### Option A: Keep the Pinyin (Original Name)  


If you really like your original name and want consistency, this is fully respected.  

- Your name stays: *Yifei Wang*  

**Pros:**  
- Authentic: Your name is an important part of your identity, and keeping it is perfectly fine.  
- Unique: Others may find your name cool and international.  

**Challenges:**  
- Pronunciation: You’ll need to patiently teach people. Americans might say “Yi-fee” or “Yih-fai.” You can guide them to say “Ee-fay” (/iː.feɪ/).  
- Spelling: You may often have to spell it out: “Y as in Yang, I as in Ice, F as in Frank, E as in Edward, I as in Ice.”
