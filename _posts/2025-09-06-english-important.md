title : "English is important"

published : true

Finally wrote this blog. This time I may not use a cold and rational tone, because I feel quite strongly about this topic.

I know that very few people will read this post, including my whole blog, and that’s exactly why I want to write. Yes, I don’t expect my blog to get much attention.

## Only My Thoughts

For the computer industry, English is a compulsory subject. Computer technology basically originated in the United States. You need to study the history of computing, read original sources and papers, so you can’t afford to dislike English.

By 2025, translation technology has become highly advanced, making it easier than ever to localize a website into Chinese. Then do we still need to learn English? Yes. I think the more important thing is to avoid the mindset of fear and difficulty. The same knowledge point can be learned and searched on domestic video platforms, or on YouTube, but that fear of difficulty makes me prefer the Chinese environment. In the same way, this fear of difficulty also makes me reluctant to search Google Scholar, reluctant to access firsthand startup/investment information from foreign platforms. That’s the most fatal issue.

So, avoiding all those negative effects is very important for me. And there’s only one solution: deliberately cultivate English as if it were my native language.

Let me share a method I really recognize and support, one I first heard of in high school. Keep playing English audio in the background. Any content works. Play it while sleeping, while resting or relaxing during the day. I think this method is quite novel, though I haven’t actually done it myself.

The second method is to keep accumulating English phrases. The key is consistency—at least one phrase recorded daily. For me, I directly write them into a dedicated post.

The third method, which I am still experimenting with, is to design a dedicated embedded device that only runs a real-time GPT conversation service. That way, I can practice spoken English with almost no effort.

终于写这篇博客了，这次我可能不会用冷漠和理智的口吻叙述，因为我对此话题有比较强烈的情绪。

我知道此文，包括我的博客只有很少人会看，所以我才会想写一些文章。是的，对于博客我并不希望受到较多的关注量。

## 仅仅我的思想

对于计算机行业来说，英语是一门必修课，计算机技术基本起源于美国，你需要去看计算机的发展历史，需要去看原生的资料和论文，所以不能对英语有反感。

翻译技术在2025年已经十分成熟，让一个网站中文化变得前所未有得简单，那还需要学习英语吗？是的，我觉得更重要的是 避免畏难心理。同一个知识点，可以在国内视频网站学习和搜索，也可以在 Youtube搜索学习，但是 畏难心理 会让我优先选择中文环境。同样的，这份 畏难心理，也会让我 抗拒去搜索 Google Scholar,让我抗拒接受 一手的X平台创业/投资消息，这才是最致命的。

所以，避免 上面的种种不良影响 对我来说很重要，解决方法也只有一个，那就是将英语作为 原生语言 去刻意培养。

我分享一个我很认可且支持的办法吧，那是我高中时候听说的办法。持续播放 英文背景音频，什么内容都可以，睡觉也播放，白天休息娱乐也播放，我觉得这个方式确实很新颖，但是我还没有做到。

第二个办法，持续不断积累英文短语。这件事贵在坚持，每天至少记录一条。对我来说，我直接写在一篇专门的贴文里面。

第三个办法，也是我还在尝试的办法，就是设计一个专门的嵌入式设备，只搭载实时的GPT对话服务，这样可以 最无感地锻炼口语。
