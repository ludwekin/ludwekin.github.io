## ARM Development History

---

### 1980s: Origins
- **1983–1985**: Acorn Computers (UK) developed the first ARM processor (Acorn RISC Machine) for their personal computers.
- **1985**: ARM1 prototype built, used in BBC Micro co-processor board.
- **1987**: ARM2 released, simple RISC design, very low power consumption.

---

### 1990s: Commercial Expansion
- **1990**: ARM Ltd founded as a joint venture (Acorn, Apple, VLSI Technology).
- **1993**: ARM6 used in Apple Newton (first big commercial product).
- **1994–1998**: ARM7 and ARM9 families introduced, becoming dominant in embedded systems.
- Licensing model established: ARM designs, others manufacture.

### 2000s: Mobile Revolution
- **2001**: ARM11 launched, used in first iPhone (2007).
- **2005–2008**: Cortex-A, Cortex-R, Cortex-M families introduced (application, real-time, microcontroller).
- ARM becomes the heart of nearly all smartphones.

---

### 2010s: 64-bit and Datacenter
- **2011**: ARM Cortex-A15 competes with higher performance CPUs.
- **2012**: ARMv8-A announced → 64-bit support.
- **2014–2016**: Apple A-series chips (ARM-based) achieve PC-class performance.
- ARM servers start to appear (Cavium ThunderX, Amazon Graviton).

---

### 2020s: High Performance & Ubiquity
- **2020**: Apple announces transition to ARM-based Apple Silicon (M1 chip).
- **2021**: ARMv9 architecture released (focus on AI, security, SVE2).
- **2020s**: ARM dominates smartphones, IoT, and grows in cloud datacenters (AWS Graviton3, NVIDIA Grace).
- Expanding into automotive and high-performance computing (HPC).

---

### Key Features of ARM Success
- **RISC design**: simple, efficient instructions.
- **Low power**: ideal for mobile and embedded systems.
- **Licensing business model**: many companies (Apple, Qualcomm, Samsung, NVIDIA, etc.) can build ARM chips.
- **Scalability**: from tiny IoT microcontrollers to supercomputer processors.

## About RISC

---

### Why "RISC-V" and not "RISC-IV"?
- **RISC-V is the fifth major RISC from Berkeley**.  
- RISC-IV existed in research form, but not as a widely adopted ISA.  
- RISC-V was named to mark a **new, open, and global standard**, different from the earlier academic-only projects.
