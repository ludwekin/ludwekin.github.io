## What is Unity's Universal 3D Sample?

---

### What It Is
- The **"Universal 3D Sample"** is a **Unity sample project** provided as a template.  
- It is built on the **Universal Render Pipeline (URP)**.  
- Purpose: to give developers a **ready-to-use 3D environment** with basic settings, materials, and lighting, so they can quickly start a project.

---

### Features
- Pre-configured **URP pipeline asset** (better performance across devices).  
- Example **3D scene** with:
  - Lighting setup (Directional light + Skybox + Environment settings).  
  - Standard 3D objects (cube, plane, camera).  
  - URP-compatible shaders and materials.  
- Configured **post-processing** (Bloom, Color adjustments, etc.).  
- Optimized default quality settings (for PC, console, and mobile).  

---

### Purpose
- **Beginner friendly**: instead of starting from a blank project, you already have a working 3D scene.  
- **Cross-platform**: works on PC, Android, iOS, WebGL, etc.  
- **Demo**: shows how URP handles lighting, materials, and performance.

## Who Uses It
- New Unity learners → to experiment with 3D.  
- Prototypes → quick start for game ideas.  
- Tech demos → to test rendering features.  







## a bunch of random stuff

1. lua语言其实很出名的。游戏大厂要求的“热更新”肯定需要lua。
2. winform一阵划拉，也挺快的。
