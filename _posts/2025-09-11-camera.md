I have always been wondering the principle of image shotting.

A video as posted shows somehow answeer my question.[panoramic camera principle](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1n8hJzpEdZ/?spm_id_from=333.1007.tianma.13-1-38.click&vd_source=bdb655fa0a3eb3c043d2c9524d6aa41d).

Look the photo below, if the hole is not small enough, the camrera cmos will get too much cast forming a spot.

however, if the hole is samll enough, images will be just fine.

Oh, fantastic. I have also figured outt the principle of camrera lens.

the minimal principle for a len can be shown as a "convex len".

Look the image below. Be careful that one point from the object can cast all reflected lights to a single point on cmos though this fantastic convex len.
