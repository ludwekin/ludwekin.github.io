### Finding Fun in English Spelling

1. “Why is ‘cockpit’ spelled as ‘cock’ + ‘pit’?”

	-	“Cockpit” = “cock” + “pit.” In Early Modern English it literally meant a pit for cockfighting.
	-	By metaphor, it later meant a cramped/busy control area on ships, then the pilot’s control area in aircraft.
	-	English often closes compounds over time, so “cock pit” → “cock-pit” → “cockpit.”
