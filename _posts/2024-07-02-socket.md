## socket network programming

Main workflow of socket network programming?

Socket programming is divided into server side and client side.

- Server side: `socket -> bind -> listen -> accept -> send/recv -> close`  
- Client side: `socket -> connect -> send/recv -> close`

Why can socket work? Its relation with the operating system.

1. Socket as an OS abstraction
	- Socket is an abstraction provided by the operating system.  
	- In Unix/Linux/Windows, “everything is a file.”  
	- A socket is just a **file descriptor**, similar to what you get from `open()`.  
	- The value returned by `socket()` is not a real hardware interface but a handle assigned by the OS.

2. System calls
	- Functions like `send()` and `recv()` in C are system calls.  
	- The path is: Application → **user mode** → system call → switch to **kernel mode**.  
	- The kernel’s TCP/IP stack then processes the data.

3. TCP/IP protocol stack in the kernel
	- The OS kernel contains implementations of ARP, IP, TCP, UDP, etc.  
	- The stack handles details your program doesn’t need to manage:  
	  - Data segmentation and reassembly  
	  - Checksum calculation  
	  - Packet loss handling and retransmission  
	  - Flow control

4. Driver and NIC (Network Interface Card)
	- The protocol stack passes data to the NIC driver.  
	- The driver uses the NIC hardware to send data over the physical link (cable, Wi-Fi, etc.).  
	- Receiving works in reverse: NIC → driver → kernel protocol stack → your socket.



## REST API

What's REST API?

Let's find out its origin and definition.

The concept of REST (Representational State Transfer) was introduced by Roy Fielding in his doctoral dissertation in 2000.  
	- Roy Fielding is a computer scientist and one of the principal designers of the HTTP protocol.  
	- REST is not a specific software or product, but an architectural design principle.  
	- Its purpose is to guide the design of web systems, making them simpler, more scalable, and easier to maintain.  

Reasons for becoming a mainstream standard?

1. Cross-Platform Compatibility
   - Front-end web pages, mobile applications, and IoT devices can all call REST APIs.  
   - No need to use the same programming language.  

2. Simplicity and Intuitiveness
   - Based on the HTTP protocol (GET/POST/PUT/DELETE).  
   - URLs correspond to resources, and HTTP methods correspond to operations.  
   - Easy for developers to understand and use.  

3. Stateless Nature
   - Each request is independent, and the server does not store client state.  
   - Facilitates horizontal scaling; adding more servers does not affect clients.  

4. Good Scalability 
   - New resources can be added independently without breaking the existing system.  
   - High degree of modularity in the system.
