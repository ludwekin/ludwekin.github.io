## Isaac Sim

Isaac Sim is NVIDIA’s robotics simulation platform built on the Omniverse framework. It provides a high-fidelity, physics-based environment for developing, training, and testing robots using synthetic data and reinforcement learning. Its history began in 2017 when NVIDIA introduced Isaac SDK and Isaac Sim (first version) to support AI robotics development with GPU acceleration. The early Isaac Sim was based on the Unity game engine but later migrated to the Omniverse platform (2020 onward) for photorealistic rendering, scalable cloud simulation, and better integration with AI workflows. Today, Isaac Sim is widely used in research and industry for digital twins, warehouse automation, and collaborative robotics.


## URDF

URDF stands for Unified Robot Description Format. It is an XML-based file format used in robotics (especially with ROS) to describe a robot’s physical and kinematic properties, such as its links, joints, dimensions, mass, inertia, sensors, and visual/ collision models. A URDF file allows simulators, motion planners, and visualization tools (e.g., RViz, Gazebo) to understand the robot’s structure and behavior consistently.

### Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement Learning (RL) is a branch of machine learning. It studies how an agent learns decision-making policies in an environment through interactions with it, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards. The core idea is trial-and-error combined with reward feedback.

Reinforcement learning belongs to the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning (ML), and control theory.

The mathematical foundations of reinforcement learning include probability theory, statistics, optimization, and Markov Decision Processes (MDP).

Markov Decision Process may feel unfamiliar.


### Moment vs Torque

| Aspect          | Moment                     | Torque                       |
|-----------------|----------------------------|-------------------------------|
| Focus           | Rotation at a point        | Rotation around an axis       |
| Typical Context | Statics, structures        | Motors, engines, rotating parts |
| Application     | Levers, beams, bending     | Shafts, screws, propellers    |




### ROS history

Robot Operating System (ROS) originated at Stanford University’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory in 2007 and was later developed and maintained by Willow Garage as an open-source middleware framework for robotics. Its first stable release, ROS 1, gained traction in academia and industry for providing reusable software libraries, message-passing infrastructure, and simulation tools. As robotics applications grew in complexity, limitations in scalability and real-time performance led to the development of ROS 2, launched in 2017, which adopted the Data Distribution Service (DDS) standard for improved communication, security, and multi-platform support. Today, ROS continues to evolve as a global community-driven project, widely used in research, prototyping, and increasingly in commercial robotic systems.

#### Distributed and Loosely Coupled in ROS

This idea is important.

Different program modules (called **nodes**) can run on the same machine or across multiple machines. They coordinate via network communication (topics, services, actions).  

Publishers and subscribers are independent and unaware of each other’s implementation details.  

The name of a node in the system must be unique.

#### commands on ROS 

`rqt_graph`, this command quickly shows the system function and overview.


#### node in ROS

Every node in ROS is a process, which can be specified as a pid number.
