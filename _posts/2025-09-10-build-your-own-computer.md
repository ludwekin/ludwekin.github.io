I sledomly watch a video on Youtube, which is about the basics of a computer. It shows the princlpe of the basic logic gates in a computer. The link is shown. [Exploring How Computers Work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZwneRb-zqA).

### xor

Xor gate, which is 'exclusive or gate', it puzzled me for a little time.

First, why xor means exclusive or? This is very interesting! Below is a truth table of 'or gate'.

| A | B | A OR B | A XOR B |
|---|---|--------|---------|
| 0 | 0 |   0    |    0    |
| 0 | 1 |   1    |    1    |
| 1 | 0 |   1    |    1    |
| 1 | 1 |   1    |    0    |

So, the exclusive means, i want the input to be only one '1' instead of being two same '1'. so exclusive or just makes a xor gate.

One bit adder is somehow not hard. But the 4 digit adder is hard.


### punch hole to program

为什么纸带打孔也能实现编程？

    问了GPT：有孔就是1，没孔就是2。然后读纸带的时候是有时序的。机器会一格一格地送纸。而且纸带上还有专门的定位孔保证不错位。常用**八道纸带**。
