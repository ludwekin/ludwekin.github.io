## 博客发展历程

博客从一开始的 个人笔记/日记 混杂，格式混杂，到后来的 定期发布 的学习笔记，再到现在的 学习笔记/项目展示/经验分享 模式，历经了差不多2年多。期间停笔很多次，也删了很多很多笔记/日记（有时候看之前写的内容很幼稚🙄），甚至一开始还不是这个站点（aws服务器）。我觉得这些经过挺有意思的，值得一记。

---

### 想要创建网站，萌芽阶段

这个阶段的我刚上大学，时间充裕（并没有，课很多），考虑建一个网站，但是不知道要网站做什么。当时买了一个 建站教程，那是一个教人怎么快速搭建发卡网站的教程。

后面大一下学期，陆续接触到了 宝塔服务器，接触到了域名/网站备案，接触到了 云计算，不过还是没有搞清楚 **要做什么样的网站**。

---

### 记录的思想

我没想过记录自己，也没想过记录自己的学习笔记，直到大二。

当时 Notion 很出名，包括 Obsidian 啥的，但是当时我看太多这类帖子 都像是卖课的，而且看起来入门很难就没有尝试。

不过我也开始 记录 了。那是大二左右，我手机换成了苹果。很喜欢 苹果的简约，尤其是 自带的笔记软件 —— Notes。然后也用 了 Reminder。 后面 发现我记下太多，太多来不及整理的 Reminders,然后发现写的 Notes 也是格式杂乱自己都不想看，心情一度不是很好。删了很多笔记。

---

### 转机？不至于，就是偶然

大概大三，我开始用 Notion,同时规定自己好好记录，不管是记录 日记，还是写 学习笔记，甚至技能输出，写了就不要删了！

到这里已经基本 达到我喜欢的状态了。是的，学 Notion 的过程我都不用写，因为就是随心记，但是 我可能确实和这个软件比较投缘，没怎么学我写得也比较规范（自己看得过去）。然后 就是开始系统整理 各个灵感和思绪，各个笔记。此时还没有考虑过 **输出**。

对了，这时我办了一张新加坡的信用卡。由此申请到了 AWS 的云服务器。利用 EC2 我开始学习搭建网站，Ubuntu 系统 敲命令敲到梦里都是 ssh 的黑色界面，最后还是没成功。走了捷径，用 宝塔面板 直接搭好了 WordPress 网站。

（中途的坑实在太多了，比如我一开始很反感臃肿的宝塔，用了一个开源的 1panel,然后服务器性能不足，奔溃10次。遂作废。）

我又研究了如何 绑定域名。搜索中文/英文互联网良久，最后 申请到了免费的 ClouDNS 家的二级域名，很漂亮的域名，也绑定到了网站。可惜没有存图了。我最终还是注销了 AWS。因为只有一年的免费期。虽然每年都可以重新申请，但还是不如一个 **更好的办法**。

---

### 内容输出阶段

到这一步了，也差不多是最近一段时间的事了。

**更好的办法**，也就是我现在的这个站点，是 Github 的静态托管页面。优点很明显，就是 免费。

此时开始学习 markdown 语法，偶尔也写一下 项目经历和技术分享。到这里就分享差不多结束了。

剩下的下次写。因为如何输出内容，这个没讲完，我也在尝试。

## 总结

多多记录吧，我也不知道原因，也许挺有意义的。

## Development Journey

This blog started as a mix of personal notes/diaries with inconsistent formats, then shifted to regular study notes, and now it has evolved into a mix of study notes, project showcases, and experience sharing. It has been a little over two years. During this period, I paused many times, deleted a lot of entries (sometimes my old writings felt too childish 🙄), and in fact, it wasn’t even hosted on this site at the beginning (it was on an AWS server). Looking back, I think this journey is quite interesting and worth recording.

### The Initial Spark: Wanting to Build a Website

Back when I first entered university, I had plenty of time (well, not really, there were many classes), and I thought about building a website, though I wasn’t sure what kind of website it should be. At that time, I bought a tutorial that taught how to quickly set up a simple card-selling website.

Later, during the second semester of my freshman year, I came across Baota Server, domain registration/ICP filing, and cloud computing. However, I still had no clear idea of **what kind of website I wanted to build**.

---

### The Idea of Recording

I never thought about documenting my life or my study notes—until sophomore year.

At that time, Notion was getting popular, as well as Obsidian. But most of the posts I saw about them looked like marketing for online courses, and they seemed hard to get into, so I didn’t try them.

Still, I began recording things. Around sophomore year, I switched to an iPhone. I liked Apple’s simplicity, especially the built-in Notes app. I also used Reminders. But I soon realized I had too many reminders to organize, and my notes were messy and unpleasant to read. That made me frustrated, and I ended up deleting many of them.

---

### A Turning Point? Not Really, Just by Chance

Around junior year, I started using Notion and made a rule for myself: record properly—whether it’s a diary, study notes, or even skill outputs—and never delete them once written!

By this stage, I had reached a state I liked. I didn’t even need to “study” how to use Notion; I just used it naturally, and it turned out quite neat (at least for myself). I began systematically organizing ideas, notes, and thoughts. Still, I hadn’t considered **publishing** anything yet.

Around that time, I also applied for a Singapore credit card, which allowed me to get an AWS cloud server. I used EC2 and spent nights typing commands on Ubuntu, with the black ssh terminal even haunting my dreams. In the end, I failed to set it up properly. Instead, I took a shortcut: using Baota Panel to set up a WordPress site.

(There were lots of troubles along the way—for example, I initially disliked Baota because it felt too bloated, so I tried an open-source alternative called 1Panel. But my server wasn’t powerful enough and crashed more than 10 times. I gave up eventually.)

I also learned how to bind a domain. After searching through both Chinese and English resources, I finally got a free subdomain from ClouDNS. It was a nice-looking domain and I bound it to the site. Unfortunately, I didn’t save any screenshots. In the end, I shut down the AWS server because the free trial only lasted one year. Sure, I could reapply every year, but I wanted a **better solution**.

---

### The Content Output Stage

This is the most recent stage.

The **better solution** is what I’m using now: a static website hosted on GitHub Pages. The advantage is obvious—it’s free.

At this point, I started learning Markdown syntax and occasionally writing about project experiences and technical sharing. That’s about where I am now.

The story isn’t finished yet, though. I haven’t fully figured out how to consistently output content, and I’m still experimenting with it.

## Conclusion

Record more. I don’t know the exact reason, but maybe it really is meaningful.
