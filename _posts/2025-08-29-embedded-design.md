### about arm cortex

I have always had a question: now that STM, NXP, and Nordic just produce MCUs embedding an ARM Cortex core, is it possible for me to make a PCB directly from an ARM Cortex core?

Yes, it is possible, but not practical for an individual.  

Main reason is that you need "ARM IP license", which is expensive, usually millions of USD, not for individuals.

### PC mother board and embedded pcba

PC, especially Windows/Linux oriented computers consume too much power. 

PC motherboard values modular features. Take a look at their motherboards, you will find them just large. With a lot of slots, hardwares like grafic card and memory module can insert into the motherboard. This design makes motherboard easy to break facing vibration.

However, embedded pcba makes it facing vibration. Embedded pcba may not have the ability like PC motherboards to quickly plug-in & plug-out, but they can be designed smaller.

Talking about power consumption, embedded pcba do cost less.
