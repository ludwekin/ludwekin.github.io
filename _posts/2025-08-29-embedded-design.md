I have always had a question: now that STM, NXP, and Nordic just produce MCUs embedding an ARM Cortex core, is it possible for me to make a PCB directly from an ARM Cortex core?

Yes, it is possible, but **not practical for an individual**.  

Main reason is that you need "ARM IP license", which is expensive, usually millions of USD, not for individuals.
