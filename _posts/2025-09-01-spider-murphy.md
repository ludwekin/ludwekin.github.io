> You guys who live in Realspace; you move so slow. Me I like Netspace. It moves fast. You don't get old, you don't get slow and sloppy. You just leave the meat behind and go screamin'. First system I ever hit, I think they had some weeflerunner playin' Sysop for them. I burned in, and jolted the guy with a borrowed Hellbolt, and did the major plunder action all over the Data Fortress. Somewhere out there is a guy with half his forebrain burned out. I wonder if they ever found the body. I wonder if they'll find mine the same way...
