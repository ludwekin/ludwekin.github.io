The first time I systematically learned control theory was through a YouTube channel: [MATLAB](https://www.youtube.com/@MATLAB).




The following is the content I have organized.  

### Sliding Mode Control, SMC

Sliding Mode Control (SMC) was systematically proposed in the late 1950s to early 1960s by Soviet scholars such as V. I. Utkin (Vladimir I. Utkin). Utkin’s 1977 paper and his later book *Variable Structure Systems with Sliding Modes* laid the theoretical foundation of SMC.  

### Variable Structure Control, VSC

Variable Structure Control (VSC) is a nonlinear control method. Its basic idea is:  

- Instead of using a fixed control law, different control laws are applied depending on the system state in different regions.  
- Through such switching, the system exhibits the desired stability during the dynamic process.

### spwm

SPWM (Sinusoidal Pulse Width Modulation)  
- A special type of PWM that uses a sinusoidal signal to modulate a triangular carrier wave, resulting in pulse widths that vary according to a sinusoidal pattern.  
- The equivalent output voltage fundamental wave approximates a sine wave, with low harmonic content.  
- Applications: inverters (DC → AC), UPS systems, electric vehicle drives.  

### pwm

PWM (Pulse Width Modulation)  
- Uses pulses of fixed frequency, controlling voltage or power by varying the duty cycle (the ratio of high-level time to the total period).  
- The waveform is a rectangular pulse.  
- Applications: motor speed control, LED dimming, switching power supplies.
