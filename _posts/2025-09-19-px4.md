## px4

I organize the content mainly in sequence, and the headlines just serve as cues or brief summaries of what each section contains.  

### px4 & ardupilot

In general, a flight controller tower that supports PX4 can also run ArduPilot, but not necessarily the other way around.  

### autopilot

The "brain" of the drone is called an autopilot.

It minimally consists of flight stack software running on a real time OS ("RTOS") on flight controller (FC) hardware. The flight stack provides essential stabilisation and safety features, and usually also some level of pilot assistance for manual flight and automating common tasks, such as taking off, landing, and executing predefined missions.

Some autopilots also include a general-purpose computing system that can provide "higher level" command and control, and that can support more advanced networking, computer vision, and other features. This might be implemented as a separate companion computer, but in future it is increasingly likely to be a fully integrated component.


### what's px4 consistence

PX4 is a core part of a broader drone platform that includes the QGroundControl ground station, Pixhawk hardware, and MAVSDK for integration with companion computers, cameras and other hardware using the MAVLink protocol. PX4 is supported by the Dronecode Project.

### QGroundControl

QGroundControl communicates with the drone using a telemetry radio (a bidirectional data link).

QGroundControl desktop versions are also used to install (flash) PX4 firmware and configure PX4 on the drone's autopilot/flight controller hardware.

### manual control

Pilots can control a vehicle manually using either a Radio Control (RC) System or a Joystick/Gamepad controller connected via QGroundControl.


QGroundControl allows you to control a vehicle using a joystick or gamepad instead of an RC Transmitter.



### payloads

Payloads are equipment carried by the vehicle to meet user or mission objectives. PX4 supports a wide range of vehicle payloads, including cameras of various types, cargo, instrumentation, and so on.

Payloads are connected to Flight Controller outputs, and can be triggered automatically in missions, manually from an RC Controller or Joystick, or from a Ground Station (via MAVLink/MAVSDK commands).    

### MAVSDK

MAVSDK is primarily written in C++.

### MAVLink

MAVLink was first released early 2009 by Lorenz Meier and has now a significant number of contributors.




### Telemetry Radios/Modems

Telemetry Radios can (optionally) be used to provide a wireless MAVLink connection between a ground control station like QGroundControl and a vehicle running PX4. This makes it possible to tune parameters while a vehicle is in flight, inspect telemetry in real-time, change a mission on the fly, etc.












### most basic control of floating

In the case that the quadcopter floats in the air, the four motors must cooperrate to make aircraft stable.




















## Algorithm


### throw launch

"Throw Launch is also supported, in which the vehicle activates motors after it detects that it has reached the apex of a throw, and then operates according to its current mode."

So, how do we achieve the goal to throw launch?


## Porting

### px4 for esp32

I watched a video to run px4 on esp32.

His hardware:
    IMU:ICM-20602
    mag:IST8310
    baro:MS5611

Really harecore. The core for the feasibility is that nuttx supports esp32 now.
