Let's talk about "f450" first.

What is the F450?

The F450 is a quadcopter frame kit, originally manufactured by DJI. It's a relatively simple, affordable, and well-documented platform that has become a standard for learning drone development and flight controller programming.

The number "450" refers to the diagonal motor-to-motor distance in millimeters. This is a standard naming convention in the multirotor community:

    - The diagonal wheelbase (distance between opposite motors) is 450mm
    - This puts it in the "medium" size category - not too small to be fragile, not too large to be unwieldy
    - Other common sizes follow the same pattern: F330 (330mm), F550 (550mm), etc.
